Note About DOM Manipulation Lectures
Section 13, Lecture 137
Hi Everyone!

As you begin working with the DOM you'll be writing some JavaScript code that selects HTML elements from the page and manipulates them. 

When doing this, be sure to include your JavaScript code at the bottom of the HTML document, right before the closing </body>  tag.

The HTML will need to have loaded before the JavaScript is run, otherwise the JavaScript will throw an error because the HTML that it is trying to select and manipulate doesn't exist (yet).

See example below:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Test</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Some HTML Code Here</h1>
 
    <script src="scriptfile.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
Thanks,
Ian
